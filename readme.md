##  How It's Made:
Tech: CSS, JavaScript, HTML

## Optimizations

To keep the code tidy, I created a seperate javascript file purely for the shopify links. 

## Future Optimizations
The shopify buy button works by giving the cart button a specific id which is linked to the javaScript code, which is generated from and copied from Shopify.

Image of HTML:

I want to improve shopify's "buy buttons" code because the code is 175 lines for one item's button, but the script repeats with the exception of "id" and "node". It would be ideal if I could create a reusable object

However, nothing in shopify's documentation helped me with this specific issue: https://shopify.github.io/buy-button-js/. I investigated the data and also asked other software engineers for advice, however I was not able to come up with a way to clean up the code that was workable. I would love to go back and clean up this code one day.
